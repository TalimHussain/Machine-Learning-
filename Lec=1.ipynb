Based on these patterns, the system will try to predict the different types of fruit and segregate them. Finally, it keeps track of all the decisions it made during the process to ensure it is learning. The next time you ask the same system to predict and segregate the different types of fruits, it won't have to go through the entire process again. That’s how machine learning works"
